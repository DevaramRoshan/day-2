      At least three leafy vegetables are combined to prepare this extraordinary
      dish. It is called Kalagoora Pulusu because of the very fact that many
      vegetables are brought together to make one dish. ‘Kalagura’ means mixed
      vegetables. Pulusu refers to the sourness of Tamarind. This dish tastes
      very nice with hot rice or Chapathi.
      <br />Traditionally the Telugu people prepare a mixed vegetable dish for
      Sankranti festival. They use leafy vegetables, Ash Gourd, Drumstick, Sweet
      Potato, and any other vegetable close at hand to make the mixed sour
      curry. In this recipe however we are going to use only leafy vegetables.

    <h2 style="margin-left: 50px">Tips</h2>
    <hr />
    <div style="margin-left: 50px">
      <h3>Green Leafy Vegetables</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I have selected Chukka Koora (Green Sorrel/ Khatta Palak) and Menthi
          Koora (Fenugreek Leaves/ Methi). You can of course mix any other green
          leafy vegetables available near you. Just ensure that each leafy
          vegetable that you select should have a unique taste of its own. For
          example, the Sorrel leaf is sour to taste and the Fenugreek is bitter.
          The Asparagus leaf is slightly nutty and has an undefined Umami about
          it. The speciality of this dish is to combine these differences. Also,
          these very differences can contribute to innumerable curative
          potentials when mixed together.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Brinjal</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          When this curry is prepared in my family we add at least one Brinjal
          cut into pieces. This gives a new look and a unique taste to the
          curry. Brinjal can be replaced by Ladies’ Fingers as well. Both these
          vegetables taste very good when the sourness of Tamarind is infused in
          them.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Bengal Gram(Chana Dal)</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You will notice that I have added the Chana Dal to the seasoning.
          Alternately, you may soak the Chana Dal and boil it along with the
          leafy vegetables. This will enhance the taste very effectively.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>To thicken the Pulusu</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Usually the soup is runny. so, At the end, add a small amount of gram
          flour or rice flour water and boil. This will thicken the Pulusu and
          make it suitable for eating with rice.
        </li>
